# Playlist Recommender App

This is a Streamlit web application for generating song recommendations based on user input or selected theme. The app utilizes song embeddings and cosine similarity to suggest songs that are similar to the user's query or belong to a specific theme, and clustering with KMeans to divide the songs into 20 distinct themes.

## How to Use

1. **Select a Theme**: Choose a theme from the dropdown menu. You can choose from the list of themes or select 'All Themes' to get recommendations from all themes if you provide input.

2. **Provide Input**: Optionally, you can input some text to refine your playlist.

4. **Listen on Spotify/YT Music**: Once recommendations are generated, you can click on the song titles to open them directly and listen to them.
